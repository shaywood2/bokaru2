                    our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
                <p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say
                    no.</p>
                <h3>How do I withdraw my consent?</h3>
                <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by
                    contacting us at <a href="mailto:admin@bokaru.com" target="_blank">admin@bokaru.com</a>.</p>
                <h2>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h2>
                <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
                <h2>SECTION 4 - DATA STORAGE</h2>
                <p>Our site is hosted on Amazon Web Services. They provide us with the hosting platform that allows us to offer our services to you.</p>
                <p>Your data is stored through our data storage facilities, databases and the general application. We store your data on a secure server and leverage industry standard security and
                    encryption technology to protect its privacy to the best of our ability.</p>
                <h3>Payment:</h3>
                <p>When you enter your credit card information in order to pay for a service on our site then our site will forward your credit card data to a secure payment gateway for processing. We do
                    not process or store your credit card data on our site at all as per industry standard. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).</p>
                <p>All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American
                    Express and Discover.</p>
                <p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.</p>
                <h2>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
                <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                    However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are
                    required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
                <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
                    In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with
                    a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider
                    or its facilities are located.</p>
                <p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that
                    transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.</p>
                <p>Once you leave our website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website's Terms of Service.</p>

                    statements.</p>
                <h2>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h2>
                <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed,
                    altered or destroyed.</p>
                <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of
                    transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.</p>
                <h3>COOKIES</h3>
                <p>We use cookies to ensure your safety when submitting payments through our system. We also use cookies to track the pages that you visit on our site in order for us to improve the
                    experience.</p>
