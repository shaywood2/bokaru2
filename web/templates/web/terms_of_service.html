                <h3>Personal safety</h3>
                <p class="c4">MAKISHITO STRONGLY ADVISES YOU TO USE EXTREME CAUTION BEFORE SHARING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH OTHER USERS OF THIS WEBSITE. MAKISHITO DOES NOT CONDUCT
                    CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON OR SCREENINGS OF ITS USERS. MAKISHITO ALSO DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ITS MEMBERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS MEMBERS BUT
                    RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES), AT ANY TIME AND USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS. YOU
                    REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER WITH ANY GOVERNMENT ENTITY.
                </p>
                <p class="c4">Your safety and security are very important to us. The nature of this Website promotes the sharing of personal information by users with other users. Makishito cannot and
                    does not assure that it is safe for you to have direct contact with other users of this Website. Current technological developments make it possible for users of the Internet to
                    obtain personal information about, and locate, other users, with very little other information. For example, it is possible to use certain widely available commercial Internet
                    search engines to locate a person&rsquo;s home solely using that person&rsquo;s correct name. If you believe that any user of this Website is harassing you or is otherwise using
                    personal information about you for unlawful purposes, we encourage you to first inform local law enforcement authorities and then to contact us via admin@bokaru.com so that we may
                    take appropriate action to block further use of the Website by any user who is using this Website and information obtained from it for improper purposes.
                </p>
                <p class="c4">IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE BUT HAVE IMPROPERLY ACCESSED THIS WEBSITE BY PROVIDING FALSE INFORMATION TO US, NOT ONLY ARE YOU AN UNAUTHORIZED USER USING THIS WEBSITE
                    IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS OF USE, BUT YOU MAY ALSO BE PUTTING YOURSELF AND OTHERS IN DANGER. YOU AGREE THAT MAKISHITO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF ANY USER OF THE
                    WEBSITE AND IS NOT LIABLE (DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY) FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE CONDUCT OF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE
                    OF THE WEBSITE.
                </p>
                <p class="c4">By accessing this Website, you agree to use any personal information provided to you by other users of this Website in a lawful and responsible manner. You further agree
                    that you will not use personal information about other users of this Website for any reason without the express prior consent of the user that has provided such information to you.
